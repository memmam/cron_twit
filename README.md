# cron_twit
A simple Python script for sending a fixed tweet. Intended for use as a Linux cronjob.

Please edit the tweet text (and either remove the image uploading code, or change the alt text), or it'll tweet that you're leaving Twitter and to find you by going to my own social media accounts, which I assume is not what you want.

Script will not work unless you fill out the API keys at the top.
